See the overall picture of implementations on microservices with .net tools on real-world e-commerce microservices project;

microservices_remastered

There is a couple of microservices which implemented e-commerce modules over Catalog, Basket, Discount and Ordering microservices with NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) and Relational databases (PostgreSQL, Sql Server) with communicating over RabbitMQ Event Driven Communication and using Ocelot API Gateway.


Run The Project
You will need the following tools:

Visual Studio 2019
.Net Core 5 or later
Docker Desktop
Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up: (Before Run Start the Docker Desktop)

Clone the repository
Once Docker for Windows is installed, go to the Settings > Advanced option, from the Docker icon in the system tray, to configure the minimum amount of memory and CPU like so:
Memory: 4 GB
CPU: 2
At the root directory which include docker-compose.yml files, run below command:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
Wait for docker compose all microservices. Thatâ€™s it! (some microservices need extra time to work so please wait if not worked in first shut)

You can launch microservices as below urls:

Catalog API -> http://host.docker.internal:8000/swagger/index.html

Basket API -> http://host.docker.internal:8001/swagger/index.html

Launch http://host.docker.internal:8007 in your browser to view the Web Status. Make sure that every microservices are healthy.
Launch http://host.docker.internal:8006 in your browser to view the Web UI. You can use Web project in order to call microservices over API Gateway. When you checkout the basket you can follow queue record on RabbitMQ dashboard.
